          <h4>Do I get to choose my meals?</h4>
          <p>
            Yes! We have 50+ seasonal menu items to choose from, and add
            something new to the menu each week. You can choose your meals each
            week via your Meal Planner; simply make sure you update your meal
            preferences for your upcoming order prior to your weekly cutoff
            (you’ll receive a weekly cutoff email reminder each week).

            Do I need to be home to accept my EasyMeal meals when they arrive?
          </h4>
          <p>
            No, as our third party carriers will leave your delivery box at your
            door, with no signature required. Our insulated boxes contain ice
            packs to ensure your meals stay nice and cold until you get home.

          <h4>Is there any cooking involved? Are your meals pre-portioned?</h4>
          <p>
            EasyMeal meals arrive at your door fresh, ready-to-eat, and
            pre-portioned, so there’s no grocery shop, cooking, or clean-up
            needed! Each EasyMeal meal comes labelled with nutritional
            information and microwave heating instructions (although some meals
            do not require heating).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>How are EasyMeal meals delivered?</h4>
          <p>
            Each EasyMeal meal delivery arrives in a 100% recyclable box
            containing non-toxic ice packs (which remain cold for 6-8 hours
            following delivery) and insulation - that's it! Please note that
            when you receive your delivery, it is not unusual for the ice packs
            to be partially melted. Meals that are cool to the touch mean that
            all is well! We recommend reusing the ice packs, or recycling the
            plastic casing, along with the insulation, in a soft plastics
            recycling bin.

        <div>
          <h4>Where do you deliver to, and when?</h4>
          <p>
            We deliver between 7am - 6pm on Thursday, Friday, Sunday, and
            Monday; delivery days depend on your location. If EasyMeal doesn’t
            deliver to your area yet, please note that we are continuously
            adding new delivery regions, so stay tuned! Sit amet consectetur
